## About this course

This course contains a series of demos introducing the Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). The AnVIL is a cloud-based platform designed to provide researchers with secure and controlled access to genomic data, as well as tools for analysis and visualization.

## Learning Objectives

*An example of learning objectives from this series are the following which apply to the first in the series (What is AnVIL?) but they seem appropriate for the general series as well.*

This course will teach learners to:  

- Understand the benefits of using cloud computing for genomic data analysis and the limitations of traditional data-sharing paradigms.
- Identify the main features and tools available on the AnVIL platform and their potential applications in genomics research.
- Learn how to navigate and access a Workspace, the starting point for a basic analysis using the AnVIL tools.
- Identify potential use cases for the AnVIL platform in your own research projects.
- Learn about additional resources to self-guide your discovery on AnVIL.
