## About this course

This course contains a series of demos introducing the Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). The AnVIL is a cloud-based platform designed to provide researchers with secure and controlled access to genomic data, as well as tools for analysis and visualization.

This particular course is comprised of several "demos", modules which can be used in an interactive classroom setting. These demos should take anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the experience of the audience.

## Learning Objectives


This course will teach learners to:  

- Understand the benefits of using cloud computing for genomic data analysis and the limitations of traditional data-sharing paradigms.
- Identify the main features and tools available on the AnVIL platform and their potential applications in genomics research.
- Learn how to navigate and access a Workspace, the starting point for a basic analysis using the AnVIL tools.
- Identify potential use cases for the AnVIL platform in your own research projects.
- Learn about additional resources to self-guide your discovery on AnVIL.
- Work through a variety of specific bioinformatic use cases on AnVIL.
