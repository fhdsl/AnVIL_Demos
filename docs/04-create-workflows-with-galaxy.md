## Review Key Concepts

This 5-min video provides a high level summary of the exercises to follow.  Several important concepts are introduced to provide context for the exercises ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nZIlyA-YIxRDYUiozl1UTXIhJJeBb7VbqlXWig7jXAk)).

## Clone Workspace

:::{.notice}
For this demo, you will need your own copy of the [`SARS-CoV-2-Genome`](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces/gdscn-exercises/SARS-CoV-2-Genome) Workspace.  These instructions will walk you through cloning a copy of the Workspace.

## Start Cloud Environment

:::: {.borrowed_chunk}

Note that, in order to use Galaxy, you must have access to a Terra Workspace with permission to compute (i.e. you must be a "Writer" or "Owner" of the Workspace).

Open your Workspace, and click on the “NOTEBOOKS” tab. Next, click on “Create a Cloud Environment for Galaxy”. You should see a popup window on the right side of the screen. Click on “NEXT” and “CREATE” to keep all settings as-is. This will take 8-10 minutes. When it is done, click “LAUNCH GALAXY”.
