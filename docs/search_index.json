[["index.html", "AnVIL Demos About this Series AnVIL Collection", " AnVIL Demos May 05, 2023 About this Series Welcome to our series of demos introducing the Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). The AnVIL is a cloud-based platform designed to provide researchers with secure and controlled access to genomic data, as well as tools for analysis and visualization. With the increasing availability of genomic data, there is a growing need for efficient and effective tools for data analysis and interpretation. The AnVIL platform addresses this need by providing researchers with easy access to a growing collection of genomic data, as well as powerful tools for analysis and visualization. Our series of demos will guide you through the various features of the AnVIL platform, and show you how it can help you to accelerate your research and make new discoveries in the field of genomics. Whether you are new to the field of genomics or an experienced researcher, these demos will provide you with valuable insights into the AnVIL platform and its capabilities. We look forward to helping you unlock the full potential of genomic data science through the AnVIL platform.

This data, along with other biomedical information, has the potential to greatly improve our understanding of healthy living and transform healthcare. To achieve these goals, we need new approaches to research that involve cloud computing, which is the only way to effectively share and analyze data at this scale. The traditional method of genomic data sharing through centralized data warehouses is becoming unsustainable and inefficient. It creates redundant infrastructure and administrative inefficiencies that make collaborative analysis challenging, especially as datasets increase in size. This approach also leads to high transfer and download costs and poses security and compliance risks. The NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-Space, or AnVIL, inverts the traditional model, providing a cloud environment for the analysis of large genomic and related datasets. By providing a secure, unified environment for data management and compute, AnVIL eliminates the need for data movement, allows for active threat detection and monitoring, and provides elastic, shared computing resources that can be acquired as needed. AnVIL currently provides secure access to hundreds of thousands of NHGRI datasets spanning nearly 5 petabytes of data and is built from a set of established components that are accessed and connected through the AnVIL Portal at https://anvilproject.org/ . The AnVIL homepage provides researchers an entry point into these tools, along with documentation, data browser, and links to related resources.
